hi 😊
Im Abdelrahman swidan 🧑‍💻 and this my first Node Js project for me 
did it for my practical exam in course object-oriented databases in fuclity of computer informatics suez canal university ❤️
in this project i used nodeJS and the package manager NPM and installed the following packages from it
=>express that provides simple APIs that its role payloding ip:port and parsing TCP and HTTP request to cool my mind about that problems 😂
=>mongoose to connect mongoDB and to be a mediator with my DB to do my operations 👌
=>nodemon (installed to use in development because i dont need to use it in deployment) 
--all this packages in dependencies in package.json 😉

                                       //================================//

in this basic project i designed basic schema for three collections "courses"," teachers" and "students" created a data model from all of them and end points to do the following =>fetch all records =>fetch the first course with specific name entered by user =>fetch all courses less than specific price entered by user =>search for a specific record by its ID with validation entered by user =>update a specific record by its ID with validation entered by user and tested all this end points in postman  😉

in the basic structure of this project i used express router and routed all end points  and used express also to parse json format of data using the new module "express.json"
bye 😊
