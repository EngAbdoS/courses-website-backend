hi 😊
Im Abdelrahman swidan 🧑‍💻 and this my first Node Js project for me 
did it for my practical exam in course object-oriented databases in fuclity of computer informatics suez canal university ❤️
in this project i used nodeJS and the package manager NPM and installed the following packages from it
=>express that provides simple APIs that its role payloding ip:port and parsing TCP and HTTP request to cool my mind about that problems 😂
=>mongoose to connect mongoDB and to be a mediator with my DB to do my functions 👌
=>nodemon (installed to use in development because i dont need to use it deployment) 
--all this packages in dependencies in package.json 😉

                                       //================================//

in this basic project i designed basic schema for three collections "courses","teachers" and "students" 
created a data model from all of them and end points to do the following 
=>fetch all recordes 
=>fetch the first course with specific name enterd by user
=>fetch all courses less than specific price enterd by user
=>search for a specific record by its ID with validation enterd by user
=>update a specific record by its ID with validation enterd by user
and tested all this end points in postman 😉


in the basic structur of this project i used express router and routed all end points 🚶
and used exprees also to parse json format of data using the new modul "exprees.json"🚶

bye 😊
